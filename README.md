Windows tools to help TTS selected text.


This is a lot of me experimenting/hacking to find ways to work around limitations of windows etc. 
. 

I wanted a way to select text and press keys to get it to TTS. 
I have a ahk script that triggers a ruby script that fires a web request at a web server wrapping windows SAPI api. 
I have that working

I wanted a way to fire a page of text form a web site at it (even if it's an HTTPS page... )
I have a node app that forwards the call from https to http app (that works)

* use online TTS service to get better speach
* clean up all the dead ends
